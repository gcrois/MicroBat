    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="letter text">
      You have been drafted to be a part of DR. SCOTT EMRICH'S HEDGE FUND.
      Many before you have tried and failed to appease DR. SCOTT EMRICH. This is not an easy task.
      Maybe you should've thought about that before you got drafted.
    </p>
    <p class="letter text">
      As you may know, DR. SCOTT EMRICH has recently completed his monopolistic takeover of all companies.
      As a result of his ascension, there is only one stock. Set your BUY ORDER by dragging the red bar higher or lower.
      Likewise, you can set your SELL ORDER by dragging the green bar. If your orders match somebody else's, a transaction will be made.
    </p>
    <p class="letter text">
      Because the stock exchange is now running on PYTHON, orders can only be processed every 5 seconds.
      See the timer on the bottom of the screen. When a transaction is completed, look at the menu at the top to see the values change.
      The value that increases will be white for the remainder of that tick.
    </p>
    <p class="letter text">
      Remember that taxes are due every 30 seconds to pay for the many great ammenities which DR. SCOTT EMRICH graciously provides.
    </p>
    <p class="letter text">
      Good luck, sacrificial lamb - oh. One more thing. If your balance reaches $&nbsp;0.00, may DR. SCOTT EMRICH have mercy on your soul.
